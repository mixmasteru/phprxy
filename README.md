phprxy: a web proxy in php

This is based on work of Brad Cable https://github.com/BCable/surrogafier released under BSD license.

The original proxy is written in monolytic php.
Anyhow its the best solution I found for a web proxy written in php which also works in shared host environment.
The goal is to refactore this nice tool into a modern, unit tested program in oop php.

# Todos:
* ~~splitup code in serveral files~~
* get code in classes
* use Framework for view
* unit test it
